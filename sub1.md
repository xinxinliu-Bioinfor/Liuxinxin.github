# Systematic identification of lncRNA biomarkers associated with prognosis of colorectal cancer immunotherapy
## Project Description
  - Colorectal cancer(CRC) is one of the malignant tumors with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world, and its immunotherapy has gradually attracted widespread attention. LncRNAs play important roles in colorectal cancer and may serve as biomarkers for prognosis in CRC.
  - We analyzed RNA-seq data for 505 CRC patients from TCGA and 41 healthy subjects to identify lncRNAs related to the prognosis of patients with immunotherapy. Moreover, we established a CRC immunotherapy prognosis scoring system to assess the response of CRC patients to immunotherapy based on biomarkers. Finally, the effectiveness of the prognostic scoring system for immunotherapy was verified through independent data sets.
  - The CRC immunotherapy prognosis scoring system provides clues for finding new drug targets for immunotherapy of CRC. In addition, it provides a theoretical basis for clinical treatment of CRC, prediction of patient prognosis of immunotherapy, and promotion of immunotherapy.
